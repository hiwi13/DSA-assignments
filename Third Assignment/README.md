What is iterative and recursive approach in algorism?

Iterative Approach :
Uses loops (for, while, do-while) to repeatedly execute a block of code

Generally more memory efficient as it doesn't use call stack

Often easier to understand for simple problems

Typically faster due to less function call overhead

Recursive Approach :
A function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem

Requires base case(s) to terminate the recursion

Often more elegant and mathematically pure

Can be more memory intensive due to call stack usage

May be more intuitive for problems with recursive nature (like tree traversals)

Complexity Analysis:
Both approaches have the same time and space complexity:

Approach  Time Complexity  Space Complexity
Iterative  O(log n)       O(1)
Recursive  O(log n)       O(log n)

Summary of Findings
Time Complexity:
Both approaches have identical O(log n) time complexity

Each iteration/recursion halves the search space

Space Complexity:

Iterative: O(1) - uses constant extra space
