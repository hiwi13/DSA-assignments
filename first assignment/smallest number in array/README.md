1, Initialize: set min _value to the first element of the array 
2, Iterate: loop through the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the last element (index n-1):
•  For each element arr[i]:
•  If arr[i] is less than  min_value ,update min_value to arr[i].
3, Return: after the loop ends, return min_value as the smallest number in the array.
