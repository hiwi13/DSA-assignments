      #Write an algorithm for finding the second or third largest element?
  
Algorithm for the second largest element
1, Initialize: 
•  First (largest element, initialized to a very small value or negative infinity).
•  Second (second largest element, also initialized to a very small value or negative infinity).
2, Iterate:
•  For each element X in the array:
•  If X is greater than first:
•  Update second to be the current first (because the previous largest element is now the second largest).
•  Update first to be X (since X is now the largest element).
•  Else if X is greater than second and X is not equal to first (to handle duplicates):
•  Update second to be X.

3, Return the second largest element.
Algorithm for the third largest element
1, Initialize:
•  First (largest element, initialized to negative infinity).
•  Second (second largest element, also initialized to negative infinity).
•  Third (third largest element, initialized to negative infinity).
2, Iterate:
•  For each element X in the array:
•  If x > first:
•  Update third to be second, second to be first, and first to X:
•  Else if x > second and x !=first:
•  Update third to be second and second to X
•  Else if x > third and x != second and x != first:
•  Update third to be X.
3, Return the third largest element.
