Ternary Search :
How It Works
Ternary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm similar to binary search but divides the array into three parts instead of two:
It calculates two mid-points: mid1 = left + (right-left)/3 and mid2 = right - (right-left)/3
Compares the target with elements at these mid-points
Eliminates either the first 1/3 or last 1/3 of the search space if the target isn't found in middle third
Repeats until the element is found or the search space is exhausted
Complexity Analysis :
Time Complexity: O(log₃ n) - slightly worse than binary search's O(log₂ n)
Space Complexity: O(1) for iterative, O(log₃ n) for recursive
Best Case: O(1) when the target is at first mid-point
Worst Case: When the target is at either end of the array
Interpolation Search
How It Works:
Interpolation search is an improved variant of binary search that estimates the position of the target value based on the values at the boundaries:
Uses the formula: pos = low + ((target - arr[low]) * (high - low)) / (arr[high] - arr[low])
This works particularly well for uniformly distributed sorted data
The search space is reduced exponentially rather than logarithmically
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) - when the estimate is perfect
Average Case: O(log log n) for uniformly distributed data
Worst Case: O(n) - when values increase exponentially
Space Complexity: O(1) for iterative implementation
Summary of Findings
Performance Characteristics
Binary Search: Reliable O(log n) for all cases
Ternary Search: Slightly slower (more comparisons per iteration) than binary search
Interpolation Search: Extremely fast (O(log log n)) for uniform data but degrades to O(n) for non-uniform data
Memory Usage:
All three algorithms have O(1) space complexity in iterative form
Recursive versions would have logarithmic space complexity
Practical Recommendations:
Use Binary Search when:
You need guaranteed performance
Data distribution is unknown or non-uniform
Implementing in performance-critical systems
Use Ternary Search when:
You're exploring algorithm variations
The cost of comparisons is extremely high
